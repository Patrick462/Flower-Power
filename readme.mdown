# Mutual Mobile Game Jam Stuff

* I haven't pushed to a shared GIT repo before, so I'm putting in a readme as an experiment.
* (PW) This is a push to github of the EXtreme Turbo Flower Segregation Simulator from 
  the September 2012 iDev 360 game jam. The theme was "growth".
* Not presented at the game jam summary the next day.
* The final build at the game jam worked (honest), but this build has problems with
  starting in the correct orientation, and having the flowers correctly bouce off the
  middle barrier. December 2, 2012.
